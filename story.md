## A case

1. A PhD student is starting to think about his dissertation research project. 
2. He's interested in infectious disease diagnosis. He wants to perform a literature review, hoping to find some inspiration.
3. He knows that some authors are starting to share datasets alongside articles. Those datasets could give him ideas for narrowing down the scope of his project, and even become part of his own research. As he has no access to proprietary software, he would also like to find data encoded in open formats.  
4. As he starts the review, he notices that it's not always obvious if a paper's data is available. And even when it is, it's not easy to decide if that data can be reused, as that depends on how data is structuerd and what software was used by researchers.  
5. He is also struggling to identify which papers contain code, and which of the papers that do contain code are reproducible. 
6. As things are at present, to figure out all of this, he'll have to spend a lot of time and put much effort into the literature review process. 
7. With OpenScore, that review becomes a more simplified process. 
8. While searching for literature, the student will see an OpenScore, ranging from zero to one. If a paper has a score of one, it means that is it truly open (i.e. it was created following every recommended open science practise). 
9. By hovering the mouse over the general score, he can even access to more specific scores regarding code availability, data openness, writing quality writing structure, and open tool usage.  
10. These scores are trustable, because they were generated by the general public.
11. With OpenScore, he can easlily decide which papers are useful for him, which contain reusable datasets, and which contain reproducible code.
