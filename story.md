1. A PhD student is starting to think about his dissertation research project. 
2. He's interested in infectious disease diagnosis.,He wants to perform a literature review, hoping to find some inspiration.
3. He knows that some authors are starting to share datasets alongside articles. Those datasets could give him ideas for narrowing down the scope of his project, and even become part of his own research. As he has no access to proprietary software, he would also like to find data encoded in open formats.  
4. As he starts the review, he notices that it's not always obvious if a paper's data is available. And even when it is, it's not easy to decide if that data can be reused, as that depends on how data is structuerd and what software was used by researchers.  
5. He is also struggling to identify which papers contain code, and which of the papers that do contain code are reproducible.
